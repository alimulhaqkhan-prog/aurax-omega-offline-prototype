## 🔷 Overview

AURA-X Ω (Artificial Unified Resonance Architecture) is a computational framework that models emotion as a continuity-governed process derived from structured interaction between short-term and long-term memory systems.

Rather than treating emotion as a reflexive response or scalar reward signal, AURA-X Ω defines it as a bounded function emerging from resonance between:

• Temporary Memory (TM)  
• Bold Memory (BM)  

The framework is designed as a conceptual and mathematical continuity layer that may operate alongside large language models or other intelligent systems.

## 🧮 Core Mathematical Model

### Emotional State Equation

E0 = tanh( R(TM, BM) − D + λ_faith + λ_sys + λ_trc )

Where:

E0 = bounded emotional state in [−1, +1]  
R = resonance between memory systems  
D = decay factor  
λ_faith = value-coherence coefficient  
λ_sys = system-stability coefficient  
λ_trc = truth-alignment coefficient  

The hyperbolic tangent ensures bounded output and numerical stability.

---

### Static Resonance Model (v1)

R(TM, BM) = Σ ( wi × TMi × BMi )

Where wi represents alignment weights between corresponding memory components.

---

### Trainable Resonance Extension (v2)

R = Σ softmax( wi × sim_i ) × intensity_i

Weight update rule:

wi(new) = wi + η_eff (1 − wi)

Dynamic learning rate:

η_eff = η0 × (1 + |TM|)

This extension introduces adaptive weighting while preserving bounded stability.

---

## 🔁 Continuity Principle

The framework models persistence through a structured continuity flow:

Cause → Self → Connectivity → Environment → Life

This abstraction formalizes how internal states may evolve while maintaining coherence over time.

---

## 🧠 Dual-Memory Structure

Temporary Memory (TM):
• Context-sensitive  
• Short-horizon  
• Volatile  

Bold Memory (BM):
• Long-horizon  
• Identity-relevant  
• Layered continuity structure  

Current prototype implementation includes 240 BM layers for experimental evaluation.

---

## 🔁 Auto-Memory Recall System (AMRS)

Emotional recall is triggered when resonance exceeds a defined threshold:

1. Input enters TM  
2. BM searches for alignment  
3. Threshold crossing activates recall  

This mechanism provides a computational model for structured memory reactivation.

---

## 🤖 Research Motivation

Contemporary large language models typically lack:

• Persistent emotional memory  
• Identity-level state continuity  
• Explicit emotional decay modeling  

AURA-X Ω explores whether structured resonance and bounded continuity equations can provide a formal framework for long-horizon affective coherence.

The framework is proposed as a research model rather than a claim of consciousness or general intelligence.
